# PlayedIt
A work in progress MERN stack project designed for UCF's Processes in Object Oriented Software Development (POOSD) course. This website and app allows for the gaming community to have a place to rate games of every console both big and small and indi developers to showcase their games next to the AAA giants of the industry. It showcases a language model used for recommending games an individual user may enjoy as well as our team's skills in building a react/vite full stack application with JavaScript, C++, HTML, and CSS in both a web and mobile application.
